CHAPTER 1: ,I saw her at the coffee shop and wanted to go over and say hello. She had bright blue hair and was named Sabrina. I mustered up the courage to go over and introduce myself and reached out to shake hands saying, “Hello, pleasure to meet you I’m William,” smiling as I gave her my name while spastically spilling my latte all over her white summer dress.

CHAPTER 2:
She got a second degree burn and had to have the ambulance called.
She wanted my name and phone number for legal action purposes.
I gave her my best friend's contact information instead.

He thought "maybe I still have a chance... If I could be with this
girl, my life would be so great. It would be perfect!"

As the ambulance carted her away, he grabbed her crumpled up napkin and stuffed it into
his pocket. He would later remember her by the smell. Everynight, he
smelled it before bed and dreamed of that day when he saw her and immediately
fell in love.

Chapter 3: 
The next day he couldn't stop thinking about her so he found the nearest 	payphone and called her. "Hello"- she answered. "HI! my name is William from the cofee shop. I just wanted to see if you would like to go to the record shop 
with me? Theres a new Flock of Seguals album that I really want to check out."
"Yes! I would love to!" she replied. The next day they went out and fell in 
love.  

Chapter 4:
The next morning, consumed with love, William walked into the street and was hit by a car. RIP William
